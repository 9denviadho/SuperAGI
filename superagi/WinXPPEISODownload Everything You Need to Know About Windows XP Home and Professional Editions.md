## What is Windows XP ISO File?
 
An ISO file is a single file that contains all the data of a CD or DVD. It is a convenient way to store and distribute software, as you can easily burn it to a physical disc or mount it as a virtual drive. An ISO file can also be used to create a bootable USB drive, which is useful for installing operating systems or repairing computers.

You can use it to install Windows XP on your computer, either as a fresh installation or as an upgrade from an older version. You can also use it to repair your existing Windows XP system if it is corrupted or damaged.
