However, using Usblyzer also comes with some risks and challenges. First of all, as we mentioned before, using a keygen to activate Usblyzer may be illegal or unsafe. You may violate the software's license agreement, infringe the intellectual property rights of its developers, or expose your computer to malware or viruses. Therefore, we advise you to purchase a legitimate license key from the official website: [https://www.usblyzer.com/order.htm](https://www.usblyzer.com/order.htm).
 
Secondly, using Usblyzer may affect the performance or functionality of your USB devices or applications.

Therefore, we advise you to use Usblyzer with caution and backup your data before using it.
 
Thirdly, using Usblyzer may expose your personal or sensitive information to others. Usblyzer may capture and display the raw data that is sent or received by your USB devices or applications. This data may contain your passwords, credit card numbers, personal files, or other confidential information. Usblyzer may also store this data in log files that can be accessed by others. Therefore, we advise you to use Usblyzer with discretion and delete or encrypt your log files after using it.
